# Play Like a Pro

âœ¨ The [players.json](https://github.com/chesslablab/chess-server/blob/master/data/players.json) file in the [Chess Server](https://github.com/chesslablab/chess-server) contains thousands of games by titled FIDE players. This file can be generated and customized with the command line tools available in the [Chess Data](https://github.com/chesslablab/chess-data) repo.

[Chess\Grandmaster](https://github.com/chesslablab/php-chess/blob/master/tests/unit/GrandmasterTest.php) figures out the next move to be made based on the JSON file that is passed to its constructor. Please make sure to first create one for it or feel free to use the players.json linked above.

```php
use Chess\Grandmaster;
use Chess\Variant\Classical\Board;

$board = new Board();
$board->play('w', 'e4');

$move = (new Grandmaster(__DIR__.'/../data/players.json'))->move($board);

print_r($move);
```

1.e4 e5 is the move that a grandmaster would play. As you can see in this example, Chess\Grandmaster could find a response to 1.e4 returning the corresponding game's metadata.

ðŸŽ‰ Let's now put our knowledge of chess openings to the test.
