# Explain FEN

âœ¨ Chess beginners often think they can checkmate the opponent's king quickly. However, there are so many different things to consider in order to understand a position.

[Chess\Tutor\FenExplanation](https://github.com/chesslablab/php-chess/blob/master/tests/unit/Tutor/FenExplanationTest.php) helps you improve your chess thinking process by explaining a FEN position in terms of [chess concepts](https://php-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/heuristics/) like a tutor would do.

```php
use Chess\Tutor\FenExplanation;

$fen = '8/5k2/4n3/8/8/1BK5/1B6/8 w - - 0 1';

$paragraph = (new FenExplanation($fen))->getParagraph();

$text = implode(' ', $paragraph);

echo $text;
```

```text
White has a significant material advantage. White has a significant control of the center. The white pieces are somewhat better connected. The white player is pressuring a little bit more squares than its opponent. The knight on e6 is pinned so it can't be moved because the king would be put in check. White has the bishop pair.
```

The resulting text may sound a little robotic but it can be easily rephrased by the AI of your choice to make it sound more human-like. Also a quick numerical estimate of the position can be obtained by passing the `$isEvaluated` parameter to the constructor.

```php
use Chess\Tutor\FenExplanation;

$fen = 'rnb1kbnr/ppppqppp/8/4p3/4PP2/6P1/PPPP3P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -';

$paragraph = (new FenExplanation($fen, $isEvaluated))->getParagraph();

$text = implode(' ', $paragraph);

echo $text;
```

```text
Black has a somewhat better control of the center. The black pieces are significantly better connected. White has a kind of space advantage. Overall, 1 heuristic evaluation feature is favoring White while 2 are favoring Black.
```

A heuristic evaluation is a quick numerical estimate of a chess position that suggests who may be better without considering checkmate. Please note that a heuristic evaluation is not the same thing as a chess calculation. Heuristic evaluations are often correct but may fail as long as they are based on probabilities more than anything else.

ðŸŽ‰ This is a form of abductive reasoning.
